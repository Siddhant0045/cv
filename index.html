    <h3> My Role Models </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma"><i>Rohit Sharma</i></a> - I started watching cricket mainly due to this guy. On 13th December 2017, I first saw Rohit Sharma play and that day he made 208* runs in an ODI match. It was his third double century in ODIs. The way he played those shots made me fall in love with him. I started following this guy ever since. I watched all highlights of his past 200s and 100s and special games. In next 9 days, he hit the fastest t20i century in just 35 balls. The way he played in that match. He didnt looked any less than a story's main character going on beast mode.</li>
